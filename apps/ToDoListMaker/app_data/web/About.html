        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <p>The @todo List Maker was conceived of, designed, and implemented by <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~richard/">Richard McKenna</a> of <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu">Stony Brook University</a>. 
            The application was built in order to help learning about making user interface frameworks and employs the
            <strong>PropertiesManager</strong>, <strong>jTPS</strong>, and <strong>Desktop Java Framework</strong> libraries, also created by and maintained by Richard 
            McKenna.<br /><br />
